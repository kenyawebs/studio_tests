## ðŸš€ **High Priority Enhancements (Next Steps)**

-   **Full End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    -   **What:** Write comprehensive tests for all critical user journeys using the Playwright framework and the test helpers we've set up.
    -   **Why:** To ensure long-term stability and catch regressions before they affect users.
    -   **Tests to write:**
        -   User signup and login flows.
        -   Profile update functionality.
        -   Posting to the social feed.

    -   **Why:** To improve initial load time and reduce Firestore query costs.

-   **Security Hardening:**
    -   **What:** Implement the remaining layers of the security model from `DATA_FLOW.md`. This includes adding rate limiting (e.g., with Cloud Functions) and hardening Firestore security rules for all collections.
