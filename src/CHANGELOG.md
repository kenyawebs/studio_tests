## [3.0.1] - Spiritual Engagement & Architecture Refactor - [Current Date]

### ✨ New Features

-   **Spiritual Reactions**: Replaced the generic "Like" button on the Social Feed with a set of spiritually meaningful reactions: "🙏 Praying," "💪 Believing," "🤗 Encouraging," and "✨ Inspired." This is the first step in transforming the platform into a true spiritual transformation engine.
-   **Testimony Categories**: Posts on the Social Feed now display a category (e.g., Breakthrough, Healing, Growth) to add more context and purpose to each testimony.
-   **Enhanced Filtering Tabs**: Added new tabs to the Social Feed for "Breakthroughs," "Questions," and "Testimonies" to create "fishing net" entry points for different audiences.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes & Architectural Improvements

-   **Fixed "Failed to load chunk" Error**: Refactored all major pages (`Giving`, `Journal`, `Bible`, `Mentorship`, `Volunteering`, `Well-being`) to use a more robust Server/Client component pattern. This resolves critical rendering errors and improves application stability.
-   **Stabilized Data Models**: Corrected several inconsistencies in the Firestore data models and related functions to prevent server-side crashes during data fetching and rendering.
-   **Performance Optimization**: Refactored data fetching on the Prayer Wall to use efficient pagination (`getDocs`) instead of costly real-time listeners (`onSnapshot`), significantly improving page load times and responsiveness.

### 📝 Project Management

-   **Added CHANGELOG.md**: This file was created to formally track all future changes and provide a clear history of the project's evolution.
