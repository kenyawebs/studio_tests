## [3.0.7] - Core Experience Overhaul - [Current Date]

### ‚ú® New Features & Performance
- **Real-time Community Wall**: Refactored the Community Wall to use real-time listeners (`onSnapshot`). New prayer requests and encouragements now appear instantly without requiring a page refresh, creating a more dynamic and connected experience. This replaces the previous, less efficient pagination system.

These rules enforce content ownership, ensure users can only modify their own profiles, and protect private data like journal entries, significantly enhancing the security and integrity of the platform.
- **Foundational E2E Testing**: Established a suite of end-to-end tests for critical user journeys, including user signup, creating a social feed post, submitting a prayer request, and updating a user profile. This provides a safety net to prevent regressions and ensure long-term application stability.

### üéØ User Experience
- Dramatically improves the perceived speed and responsiveness of the Community Wall.
- Provides users with confidence that their data is secure and private.
- Ensures a stable and reliable experience by automatically catching bugs before they reach the user.
