## [3.0.2] - AI & Performance Enhancements - [Current Date]

### ‚ú® New Features

-   **AI-Powered Post Classification**: New posts on the Social Feed are now automatically categorized by an AI model that analyzes the content for its spiritual theme (e.g., Healing, Breakthrough, Provision).
-   **Dynamic Category Filtering**: The "Filter" button on the Social Feed is now active, allowing users to select multiple spiritual categories to fine-tune the content they see.
-   **Silent Cultural Intelligence**: Added a new backend service to silently collect cultural metadata (like regional spiritual terminology) from new posts. This creates a dataset for future AI-powered cultural adaptation features without impacting current app performance.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes & Architectural Improvements

-   **Performance Optimization**: Refactored data fetching on the Prayer Wall to use efficient pagination (`getDocs`) instead of costly real-time listeners (`onSnapshot`), significantly improving page load times and responsiveness.
-   **Architectural Refactor**: Stabilized the `faith-reels` and `sermon-remix` pages by refactoring them to use the robust Server/Client component pattern, preventing future "chunk loading" errors.
-   **Auth Persistence Fix**: Corrected the "Remember Me" logic on the Login page to ensure user sessions are reliably persisted across browser sessions.
-   **Legal Page Fix**: Resolved a critical hydration error by creating a dedicated layout for legal pages (`/legal/terms` and `/legal/privacy`), separating them from the main application shell.

## [3.0.1] - Spiritual Engagement & Architecture Refactor

### ‚ú® New Features

-   **Spiritual Reactions**: Replaced the generic "Like" button on the Social Feed with a set of spiritually meaningful reactions: "üôè Praying," "üí™ Believing," "ü§ó Encouraging," and "‚ú® Inspired." This is the first step in transforming the platform into a true spiritual transformation engine.
-   **Testimony Categories**: Posts on the Social Feed now display a category (e.g., Breakthrough, Healing, Growth) to add more context and purpose to each testimony.
-   **Enhanced Filtering Tabs**: Added new tabs to the Social Feed for "Breakthroughs," "Questions," and "Testimonies" to create "fishing net" entry points for different audiences.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes & Architectural Improvements

-   **Fixed "Failed to load chunk" Error**: Refactored all major pages (`Giving`, `Journal`, `Bible`, `Mentorship`, `Volunteering`, `Well-being`) to use a more robust Server/Client component pattern. This resolves critical rendering errors and improves application stability.
-   **Stabilized Data Models**: Corrected several inconsistencies in the Firestore data models and related functions to prevent server-side crashes during data fetching and rendering.

### üìù Project Management

-   **Added CHANGELOG.md**: This file was created to formally track all future changes and provide a clear history of the project's evolution.
