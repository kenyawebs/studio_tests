# Connect Hub: Development Roadmap

This document tracks our development roadmap. We have a stable, feature-rich application ready for user testing. The next priorities focus on scaling the platform and deepening user engagement.

---

## ðŸš€ **Immediate Development Priorities**

### **1. Performance & Scalability: Implement Pagination (High Priority)**
-   **What:** Refactor the Social Feed and Community Wall to use pagination or "infinite scroll". Instead of loading all documents, fetch a limited number (e.g., 10) initially and load more as the user scrolls.
-   **Why:** This is a **critical architectural improvement** to ensure the app remains fast, responsive, and cost-effective as the amount of content grows. It's the most important step before a wider public launch.

### **2. Deepen AI Integration: Conversational AI**
-   **What:** Enhance the AI interactions. For features like the "Life Wisdom AI" and the "Well-being Hub" assistants, clicking the button should open a dedicated, interactive chat modal where users can have a proper back-and-forth conversation with the AI.
-   **Why:** This elevates our AI from a simple suggestion tool to a genuine "guidance system," which is a core part of the app's unique value.

### **3. Enhance Community Features: Comments & Following**
-   **What:**
    -   Implement a full commenting system on the Testimony Feed.
    -   Build a "follow" system allowing users to connect with each other, which will enable a personalized "Following" feed in the future.
-   **Why:** These are foundational social features that are essential for building a vibrant, long-term community.

### **4. Comprehensive E2E Testing (Ongoing)**
-   **What:** Continue to expand the Playwright test suite to cover all newly activated features, including the Giving flow, event creation, volunteering, and interactions with AI modals.
-   **Why:** To guarantee application stability and catch regressions as we add more complex features.
