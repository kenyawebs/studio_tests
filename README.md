## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   `npm` or `yarn`
-   [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/connect-hub.git
cd connect-hub
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Firebase

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  In your project, go to **Project Settings** > **General** and add a **Web** application.
3.  Firebase will provide a `firebaseConfig` object. You will need these credentials for the next step.
4.  Enable the following Firebase services:
    *   **Authentication**: Enable the Email/Password, Google, and Facebook sign-in methods.
    *   **Firestore Database**: Create a new database.
    *   **Storage**: Create a new storage bucket.
5.  Navigate to the **Rules** tab for both Firestore and Storage and paste the contents of `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` from the repository, respectively. Publish the rules.

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

1.  Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
2.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env.local` file.
3.  Fill in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables with the credentials from your Firebase project.
4.  Obtain a **Google Maps API Key** from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials) and add it to `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.

### 5. Set Up Google AI (Genkit)

1.  In your Google Cloud project (the same one as Firebase), ensure the **Vertex AI API** is enabled.
2.  Authenticate your local environment with the Google Cloud SDK:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
    This command will open a browser window for you to log in and grant permissions.

### 6. Run the Development Server

Once all setup is complete, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
