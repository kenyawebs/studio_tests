# Connect Hub: The Modern Community Platform

Connect Hub is a modern, inclusive, and AI-powered platform designed for community engagement, personal growth, and holistic well-being. Built on a robust, scalable tech stack, it provides a positive and secure online experience for users from all backgrounds.

Our core philosophy is the **"Fishing Net" strategy**: creating a welcoming environment that focuses on universal human themes of connection, purpose, service, and personal development, while providing deeper spiritual resources for those who seek them.

The application has completed a major stabilization phase and is now **Ready for Launch**. Core features have been activated, the architecture has been stabilized, and a comprehensive end-to-end test suite has been implemented.

### Next Steps:

2.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Deploy to the live domain `spiritual-connect.com` and gather feedback from select test users on stable features.
3.  **Mobile App Development**: Begin development of the native Android application, leveraging the existing Firebase backend.
4.  **Deepen AI & Social Features**: Build out conversational AI, a commenting system, and a friends/following model.
