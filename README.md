## Join The Next Revolution

We are on a mission to connect Christians with greater access to community and spiritual resources! To accomplish this audacious vision, we are open to investments with great people, who can travel with us for the long term.

### Investment Profile
This journey is very tough and it will have a lot of ups & downs. We will make investments only from seasoned entrepreneurs, professional VCs, and individuals who have been through an entrepreneurial journey. This is a high-risk, high-return investment.

### Our Vision
The intention is to build a great company that will touch people's lives in a positive way; money will be a byproduct. We are aiming for a huge impact and returns as well. We have a clear vision of creating great values for the people, and along the way, we will be making a billion-dollar company.

### Principles For Investments
-   **Culture is Core**: We will not change the culture or the people who trusted us in the early days. Our value system is our core strength, and we will scale exponentially without losing it.
-   **Long-Term Partners**: We are not just looking for money; we look for long-term partners who respect and value the vision and can strategically help us grow. If you are just looking to put money and double or 10x it, we may not be the right partner for you.
-   **No "Mentor" Equity**: We don't believe in mentors as people who can't give quick solutions without knowing the contexts; hence, we don't give free equity for mentors or brand ambassadors.
-   **Mutual Respect & Freedom**: We must mutually respect, give space, and grant freedom to each other for the benefit of the bigger purpose. We respect decisions taken in challenging situations.
-   **Trust Over Paper**: We believe in people; we value trust and a person's word rather than signed papers.
-   **Open to Suggestions**: We are open to suggestions and ideas told with the right intentions. You can suggest good things, but the final decisions are always ours.
-   **Peace of Mind**: End of the day, we have to happily sleep. Let's happily travel towards the vision and trust each other. It's a long-term relationship.
-   **Operational Independence**: We will provide quarterly updates and other key important updates. But just because you are an investor, you can't be involved in our day-to-day operations and decisions. We respect your time and expect the same.
