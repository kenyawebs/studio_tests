# Change Log for Index/Permission Debugging

This file tracks the temporary changes made to the codebase to resolve Firestore index and permission issues. The debugging process is complete, and this file serves as a record.

## 1. `package.json` Modifications

**Original `dev` script:**
```json
"dev": "NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev --turbopack -p 9002"
```

**Temporary Changes Made:**
- Changed port from `9002` to `9003` to resolve `EADDRINUSE` errors.
- Removed `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect'` flag to simplify process logging and avoid debugger port conflicts.

**Final State:**
```json
"dev": "next dev --turbopack -p 9003"
```
*(The simplified script is stable and has been kept).*

## 2. `firestore.rules` Evolution

1.  **Initial State:** Rules only defined for `/users/{userId}`.
2.  **Problem:** This caused `permission-denied` errors for all other collections. Subsequent attempts to add rules were too complex and also failed, particularly for `count` queries.
3.  **Temporary State (Used for Debugging):** Used wide-open rules to unblock the app and allow for index creation links to be generated from the terminal.
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
4.  **Final State (Production-Ready):** Deployed the final, secure ruleset once all necessary indexes were created via the generated links.

## Revert Checklist

- [x] Deploy final, secure `firestore.rules`.
- [x] Confirm `package.json` `dev` script is stable.
- [ ] Delete `FIREBASE_DEBUG_CHANGES.md` (This can be done in a future step now that its purpose is served).
